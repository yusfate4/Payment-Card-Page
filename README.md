Task title: Implement Pay by Payment Card Page

One of the core expectations of a front-end developer is the ability to write vanilla code and use frameworks effectively. In this task, you are expected to use pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; do not use any libraries except one you write yourself. 

Your task is implementing a card payment page (see attached image). Implementing the frontend (HTML and CSS) and frontend functionalities (JavaScript) would be best.
